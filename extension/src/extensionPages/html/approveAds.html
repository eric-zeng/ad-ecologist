      <h4>Last Step: Are all of these ads okay to share with us?</h4>
      <p>
        Here are screenshots of the ads that UW Ad Tracker detected from the
        sites you visited. <b>If there are any ad screenshots you would
        prefer not to share with the research team</b> (e.g. because you think
        they reveal something private about you), <b>click on them below, and
        the screenshots will not be sent to us.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose not to share some of the ads, it would really help us to
        know why you decided not to share. If you are comfortable telling us,
        please click the "Tell Us Why" button on each ad to let us know why you
        chose not to share the ad.
      </p>
      <p>
        You donâ€™t have to select any ads to exclude if you feel okay sharing
        them all with us!
