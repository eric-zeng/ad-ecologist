      <h1>AdEcologist Research Study Instructions</h1>
      <h3><b>Please read this whole page before beginning</b></h3>
      <p>
        Thank you for participating in our research study and installing our
        extension! The study instructions are given below, but
        we will guide you through as you go, so you don't need to remember
        all the steps. Here's how the study will work:
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="instructions-section">
      <img id="list-icon" src="/img/list.png">
      <div class="instructions-section-text">
        <p>
          <b>
            On the next page, we will provide you a list of websites to visit.
          </b>
          <br>
          One-by-one, please click and open each website. When you open a website
          from the list, you will see this popup:
        </p>
        <img id="adpopup" src="/img/adpopup.png">
        <br/>
        <p>
          <b>Click the "Start" button to start the data collection process. </b>
          Our extension will automatically collect data on the ads on the page.
          You may see the popup briefly disappear and reappear.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the extension scans all of the ads on the page, it will
          <b>automatically refresh and scan the page a second time.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
        While the extension is scanning a page:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Please <b>do not open or switch to new tabs or windows</b> in the web browser.</li>
          <li>
            It is ok to use your phone or other apps on your computer
            extension is collecting data, such as Zoom or Microsoft Word.
          </li>
          <li>
            If there is another popup on the web page that is <b>not</b> the
            extension popup, <b>please close it</b>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="instructions-section">
      <img id="approve-icon" src="/img/approve.png">
      <div class="instructions-section-text">
        <p><b>
            After you have visited each website, we'll ask you to
            fill out a short survey about the ads we collected.
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end, you'll have a chance to
          choose which (if any) ad screenshots you would not like to share
          with us. This is in case an ad is extremely specific to you, and you
          feel uncomfortable sharing the screenshot of the ad with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            Once you have finished collecting data on all sites, we will send you
            a link to Prolific with the completion code.
          </b>
