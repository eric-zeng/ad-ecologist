        <p>
        <ol>
        <li>Data about the ads you see (only on the sites we ask you to visit)
            <ul>
                <li>The URL of the website the ad was shown on</li>
                <li>Screenshot of the ad</li>
                <li>Amount paid by the advertisers to show you the ad</li>
                <li>Data about web trackers and analytics on the site</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          We will also use demographic info already collected from you in the
          prescreening survey.

            You will have the option to decide if you want to let us collect the ad information
            on a given web page. If you feel that the ads are too personal or don't want to share
            the ad screenshots for some other reason, you can specify which ads you want to exclude
            after finishing all sites and we won't collect them.
