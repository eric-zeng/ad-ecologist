          We want to learn about how much advertisers are paying to show you
          ads, what is in those ads, and how they might be targeting you.
          To collect this data, <b>we need you to temporarily install our
          browser extension</b>, and visit a few websites.

        <h4>Study Procedure</h4>
        <p>
          In this study, you will install our browser extension, and then visit
          10 specific websites, so that we can collect data on the ads on those
          websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are legitimate and trustworthy websites, such as
          businessinsider.com, foodnetwork.com, and speedtest.net. Visiting
          these websites will not harm you or your computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          After visiting the 10 websites, we will ask you to fill out a short
          survey about some of the ads that we collected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once all of these tasks have been completed, you can submit your
          results and receive your compensation via Prolific.

        <h4>Privacy</h4>
        <p>
          Your privacy is very important to us, and we won't ask you to share
          any data that you don't feel comfortable sharing.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We won't start collecting data from a web page until you give us
            permission.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you feel that the ads are too personal or
            don't want to share the ad screenshots for some other reason, you
            can specify which ads you want to exclude at the end of the study.
