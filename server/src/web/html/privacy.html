        the user, either directly or via the permissions API, including persistent identifiers.
    How do you use the information?
        Disclose how you use the information you collect. For example, you may
        use the information to provide certain services to users, to recognize

        <h1>UW Ad Tracker Extension Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            The goal of this project is to learn about how much advertisers are paying to show users
            ads, what is in those ads, and how they might be targeting specific users.
            <!-- All of the data for the project will be
            collected in an anonymized database which ensures that it is not Personally Identifiable
            Information, nor otherwise likely to lead to the identification or tracking of any web users. -->
        </p>
        <p>
            We are committed to protecting the privacy of all users of our extension. We
            have established this privacy policy to explain what information we collect
            through this extension and how it is used.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this policy, "the researchers" and "we" refer to any and all researchers or assistants
            otherwise involved in this research project. This project involves personnel from the
            University of Washington.
        </p>
        <p>
            The researchers are located within the United States, and therefore will transfer,
            process, and store your information in the United States.

        <h1>What information do we collect?</h3>
        <p>The extension gathers information on ads on a list of specific news and media websites.
            If you allow the extension to collect data on the website, for each ad, the extension collects: <br>
        <ul>
          <li>The price the advertiser paid to show you the ad. It also collects information on the ads that
              bid money to show up on the page but did not end up rendering. This information includes the
              advertiser bidders, how much each bidder bids, and the price of the winning bid.
          </li>
          <li>A screenshot of the ad, and its HTML content. Users may opt
            out of sharing specific ad screenshots if they feel that they are too personal.</li>
          <li>The URL of the website the ad appeared on.</li>
          <li>Data about web trackers and analytics on the site. Specifically, we collect web requests
              made by third parties on the page, and cookies set by third parties.
          </li>
        </ul></p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h1>How do we use this information?</h3>
        <p>We collect this data to conduct analyses of how advertisers might be targeting individual users,
            and the behaviors of advertisers in ad auctions.</p>
        <p>For Prolific study participants only, we will also use this data in conjunction with demographic
            data that you provide to us in a separate pre-screening survey and/or the Prolific service. We will
            use this demographic information (age, gender, ethnicity, zip code, and location) to study how
            advertisers target specific demographic categories.</p>
        <p>These analyses will strictly be used for scientific research; no data will be used for
            commercial purposes.</p>
        <!-- <ul>
            <li>The price the advertiser paid to show you the ad: to see whether the average price is different among
                different users. We will use these averages in our research paper. We will not link any
                personally identifiable information to specific users in this paper.
            </li>
            <li>A screenshot of the ad, and its HTML content: we will qualitatively analyze the types of
                ads we see on different websites. Users may opt
                out of sharing specific ad screenshots if they feel that they are too personal.
            </li>
            <li>The URL of the website the ad appeared on: to associate screenshots with ads so that we can analyze different
                websites individually.
            </li>
            <li>Data about web trackers and analytics on the site:
                the reason we collect this data is to analyze how cookies and trackers impact the price an advertiser
                is willing to pay to show you an ad. The web requests are only collected for the specific list of
                websites listed in our extension. In our research paper we will <b>not</b> be sharing cookie values
                or trackers attached
                to specific users. Instead, we will be analyzing how the number of trackers and cookies on a website
                and browser and how that impacts the price an advertiser pays for an ad.
            </li>
            </ul></p> -->
    </section>
    <section>
        <h1>What information do we share?</h3>
        <p>
            We intend to publish a research paper incorporating the data we collect. The research
            paper will not publish any individual-level user data. Instead, we
            will analyze aggregates of ad screenshot types, ad pricing, and tracker/cookie prevalence
            across different user demographic information provided in a survey from Prolific participants
            outside the study.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of this project, we may share datasets derived from this project with research partners
            working on topics related to Internet security or privacy. Before sharing, we will evaluate
            whether further sanitization or aggregation of data is necessary to reduce the likelihood
            that inferences about identifiable individuals' activities might be made from the published
            dataset. Because anonymization is an algorithmically complex problem, we cannot promise
            that it will be flawless or attack-proof.
            <!-- When we believe that a dataset may contain
            information that is especially sensitive or vulnerable to de-anonymition, we will not
            publish it, and if we share such data with research partners, we will place them under
            a contractual obligation to keep the dataset confidential and avoid de-anonymization. -->
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, we may also publicly release and publish anonymized information from datasets
            to further general scientific knowledge. The datasets we may share or publish will not
            intentionally contain peresonally identifiable information.</p>

        <h1>Data storage and retention</h1>
        <p>The extension sends the information listed above into our private
            research database for this project. The data listed above in this policy is all linked
            in the database to the
            user's specific Prolific ID (which they share with us in a survey outside of this extension).
        </p>
        <p>We will retain the dataset for as long as the data remains useful for research topics
            related to online tracking, privacy, and targeted advertising.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h1>Updating or removing your information</h1>
        <p>If you request that you no longer want us to retain the information we collected in this extension,
            we will delete it since we associate all the data with your Prolific ID. See contact information
            below if you want to request this.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h1>Security</h1>
        <p>We employ industry standard security measures to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of
            the information under our control by using appropriate technical and organizational measures
            to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. Although we make good faith
            efforts to store information collected by us in a secure operating environment, we cannot
            guarantee complete security.</p>

        <h1>Changes to Our Policies</h1>
        <p>This extension's privacy policy may change from time to time. However, any revised privacy policy
            will be consistent with the purpose of this research project. If we make any substantive changes
            to our policies, we will post notice of changes on this page.
